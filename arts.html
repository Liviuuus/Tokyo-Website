           <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; margin-top: -7%;"><h3>Edo or Tokugawa period (1603–1868)</h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69"><p>By 1590, when the military leader Tokugawa Ieyasu selected Edo as his military headquarters, the settlement surrounding Edojuku boasted a mere hundred thatch-roofed cottages. Ieyasu assembled warriors and craftsmen, fortified the Edojuku castle with moats and bridges, and built up the town. The Edo period (Edo jidai) began when Tokugawa Ieyasu became shōgun in 1603. He was the effective ruler of Japan, and his Edo became a powerful and flourishing city as the effective national capital. However, Japan's imperial seat and official capital remained in Kyoto, but the Emperor was virtually powerless.<br><br>
                
            The outer enclosures of Edo Castle were completed in 1606, and it continues to remain at the core of the city.<br><br>
                
            This period was marked by continuous growth which was interrupted by natural disasters, including fires, earthquakes and floods. Fires were so commonplace that they came to be called the "blossoms of Edo".In 1657, the Great Fire of Meireki destroyed much of the city; and another disastrous fire in 1668 lasted for 45 days.</p></div>

            <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; "><h3>Meiji Restoration (Revolution Reform) </h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69" style="padding-top: 75px;"><p>The Imperial Army seized Edo and ended the Tokugawa regime in 1868. After defeating the Tokugawa forces at Toba-Fushimi in January, Imperial forces captured Edo and exiled the Tokugawa leadership. Edo was renamed Tokyo ["the eastern capital"] and the Emperor Meiji, aged 16, was brought from Kyoto and enthroned in the palace. The urban poor played little role in the upheaval, but they grumbled about the rising prices of rice and fish and the downfall of the old bakufu leadership. Their cynical and often humorous commentary on the transition appeared in newspapers, broadsheets, handbills, and woodblock prints.</p></div>
            
            
            <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; "><h3>Education</h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69" style="padding-top: 75px;"><p>In the Meiji Era, consolidation of the government schools into the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877 brought a strong emphasis upon introducing western forms of expertise, especially in science and technology. Consultants were brought in from Europe and the United States. Kikuchi Dairoku (1855–1917), a mathematician educated at Cambridge and London, became president. Advanced schools were transformed into centers of research and publication by experts often possessing national reputation. Tight control over education was exercised by the Ministry of Education. The university soon played a role in national politics. Japanese nationalism became the centerpiece of education, and university scholars began to enter public debate as experts in many areas. <br><br>The study of law developed rapidly at Tokyo University, making the university then (and now) foremost supplier of bureaucratic office. Thus by the 1880s the university had become an invaluable political instrument to the government bureaucracy.</p></div>
            
            
            <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; "><h3>Urban planning</h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69" style="padding-top: 75px;"><p>With the end of sankin-kōtai, the daimyōs and their retinue left the city—a drain of an estimated 360,000 people—and the merchants and other workers left as well. This and the warfare surrounding the Restoration brought the population down from a high of 1.3 million in the early 19th century to about 500,000 in 1869. It took another twenty years for the population to return to its pre-Restoration peak. The population reached 2 million in 1905. In the 1870s and 1880s the nation's leaders engaged in intense discussions about the future of the capital of Tokyo.</p></div>
            
            
            <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; "><h3>Museums</h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69" style="padding-top: 75px;"><p>Meiji cultural officials modeled their policies after Berlin, London and Paris. Tokyo was to become a national capital and repository of the greatest cultural treasures from across the land. For example, the "Horyuji Homotsukan" [Hall of Horyuji Treasures] of the Tokyo National Museum displayed representative items from the Horyuji temple in Nara Prefecture. Machida Hisanari (1839–97), was the "father" of the National Museum, and used the collection to promote the restored monarchy.</p></div>
            
            
            <div class="landmarks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 45px; "><h3>1923 Kanto earthquake</h3></div>
            
            <div class="text_69" style="padding-top: 75px;"><p>At noon on Saturday September 1, 1923, the earthquake hit, registering 8.3 on the Richter scale. Seismologists found the epicentre was in Sagami Bay, about 80 km south of Tokyo, where a 100- by 100-kilometer segment of the Philippine oceanic plate broke against the Eurasian continental plate, releasing a massive amount of tectonic energy. Minutes later came the dreaded huge tsunami, with a height of 12 meters. In Yokohama, a city built on landfill, practically every structure was ruined. As fires swept across Tokyo, 75% of all buildings suffered severe structural damage. The quake cut most of the water mains. Of the population of 4.5 million, 2% to 3% were killed. Two million people were homeless. Two per cent of Japan's total national wealth was destroyed.Emergency food and clothing was provided by an international relief effort.</p></div>
